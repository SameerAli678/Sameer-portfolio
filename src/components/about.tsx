      <p>
        I&#39;m a front-end web developer and designer passionate about crafting
        visually striking and user-friendly digital experiences. With a strong
        eye for design and a love for clean, efficient code, I bring ideas to
        life through modern, responsive, and intuitive interfaces. Whether
        it&#39;s a portfolio, landing page, or full website, I focus on creating
        seamless experiences that not only look great but also feel great to
        use.
